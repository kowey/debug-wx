This is a small offering of sample files from the wxWidgets and
wxHaskell repositories to help you figure out if you have wxHaskell
installed correctly or not.

1. Do you have a working wxWidgets?

      wx-config
      cd wxWidgets
      g++ minimal.cpp `wx-config --libs --cflags` -o minimal
     ./minimal

2. How about wxcore?

      cd wxcore
      ghc --make HelloWorld
      ./HelloWorld

3. What about wx?

      cd wxc
      ghc --make HelloWorld
      ./HelloWorld

Having a wxc sampler would be nice.  I think somebody would have to
chase down all the equivalencies from the C++ version.
